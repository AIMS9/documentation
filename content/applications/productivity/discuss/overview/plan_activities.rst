Get Organized by Planning Activities
====================================

Activities can help you and your colleagues work together more effectively. Setting Activities
for yourself or others can minimize the chance that something falls through the cracks and also
keep everyone on the same page. There is also less chance two people will work on the same thing
and a potential reduction in emails and phone calls requesting help!

Where do I see my scheduled activities?
=======================================

Access and manage your activities wherever you are in Odoo by using the *Activities* menu.

Activities can be created and managed from the chatter area by clicking on *Activities*,
or through Kanban views by clicking the clock and then clicking *Schedule and Activity*.

Define your activity types
--------------------------

A number of activities types are available by default in Odoo (call, email, meeting, etc.). However,
you can create new ones by going to :menuselection:`Settings --> Activity types`.

.. tip::
   If you need to create an activity type that uses a calendar, make sure to create
   it with an *Action to Perform* set as *Meeting*.

Recommend next activities
-------------------------

Odoo helps you to plan a series of activities by allowing you to set *Recommended Next Activities*.
